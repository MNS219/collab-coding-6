Challenges faced:
We sometimes ran into merge conflicts, especially when two people edited the same file.

Integrating code from different members was tricky at times because of different coding styles and branch usage.


Some confusion happened when not everyone pulled the latest changes before starting new work.


Insights on GitHub workflows and team dynamics
Using branches for each feature made it easier to track who worked on what.


Pull Requests (PRs) gave us a chance to review each other’s code and discuss changes.


Teamwork improved as we learned to communicate before pushing big changes, reducing conflicts.


We realized that committing often with clear messages makes collaboration much smoother.


Suggestions for improvement (in simple words)
Always pull from main before starting new changes.


Create feature branches for every new task instead of working directly on main.


Use short, clear commit messages so teammates understand what changed.


Review each other’s PRs before merging, so mistakes are caught early.


Decide on some common coding style (like naming conventions) to avoid messy merges.
